	Among the world's oldest breeds, the slim but rugged Saluki was the hunting hound of kings for thousands of years. Salukis are swift and agile sprinters who love a good chase. They make gentle, dignified, and independent but loyal pets. The beauty of Salukis has been a thing of wonder for thousands of years. They're slim and leggy, but very strong and perfectly balanced, like a great athlete or dancer. Males can stand between 23 and 28 inches at the shoulder; females can be much shorter. They come in a many colors and patterns. Their large, oval-shaped eyes are warm and intelligent. Salukis are highly adaptable, able to live and work in any climate. They're magnificent animals, but owning them comes with many special challenges.
